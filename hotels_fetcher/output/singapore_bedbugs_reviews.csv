cons: the rooms are cramped including the club room. the bed and bedsheet had bed bugs, my child and i woke up with bites. the bed was small and mattress was uncomfortable. breakfast was outsourced and was arranged in a depressing conference room.",Vineet,1702280487

cons: after 2 days at sleeping at the hostel i found itchy bites all over my body which were consistent with bed bugs. upon telling this to the front desk lady, she was entirely defensive insisting how clean their place. she went as far as saying maybe the bites are from sand particles. she then ended up changing the bed sheets like she was doing me such a favour. the hostel was full so she was unable to offer another bed. through booking i requested a refund for my last night which she rejected. ultimately, i had to pay for my own stay at another facility. i am aware that bed bugs can happen to the best of facilities but it was her approach which was entirely inappropriate and irresponsible. terrible costumer service, i would not recommend this place to anyone.",Gil,1653846317

cons: hotel from hell! having previously travelled around asia with no issues this is by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. upon arrival it seemed lovely- lobby was clean and fresh but that’s where the positives end. the room smelled of damp and had visible damp patches all around the room. cockroaches and other bugs ran around the bathroom. beds were filthy and the whole place just was so unclean it was horrendous. in our fist room i was bitten badly by bed bugs so requested to move rooms for the second night. staff were very very rude and didn’t even offer an apology or anything about the bites or the state of the room. all the man with the ponytail said behind the desk was “this room is
nicer”. reluctantly we stayed a second night due to already paying and having little money left after travelling. second room was just as bad! clear dust everywhere, horrendous smell of mouldy fish (presumably due to the room having no window and the ac not working properly). the bottled water in the rooms was vile - it smelled like used gym socks so presume this had been filled up with tap water and passed on as bottle water. i asked the lady at reception if i could have a new bottle or if i could please use the vending machine but was told abruptly no whilst
she laughed in my face. at check out no one even bothered to ask us how our stay was. also note a man was also complaining at the same time so i presume this is a very common occursnce. avoid",Sophie,1658724319

breakfast buffet was excellent each day and even included variety each day. plenty to choose from to ensure good start to each day.

all staff in the bar and breakfast area were excellent. friendly, personable and attentive.

bar service and lunch and dining meals were great.

free entertainment in the bar one evening with a very talented young girl with a guitar was a nice surprise.

guest services were very busy the whole time we were there, but renowned available, friendly and helpful. 

room facilities were ok and there was sufficient room for us during an 8 day stay.

we liked the flexibility of being able to store our bags with reception before we checked in and after we checked out.
cons: there were a lot of children staying in rooms of their own on our floor and in surrounding rooms. it seems that they had no parents staying with them. on most evenings and some mornings we were disturbed by them running in and out of each other's rooms and all visiting each other in their rooms - sometimes late into the evening and even early morning. they yelled and spoke loudly in the hallways and were constantly banging doors, and yelling at each other through the doors. several times we asked them to be quiet and a couple times we also asked guest services to help.

during my stay, i was also bitten all over which i suspected to have been from bed bugs as they were not mozzie bites and occurring overnight. my wife did not show much signs of being bit, but i understand 30-60% of people do not react to bed bug bites. i did not mention this to reception as i was not sure in the first couple of days, then was sick for a couple of days and i also did not know what they could have done about it anyhow.",Andrew,No response
